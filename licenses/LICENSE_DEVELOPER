Developer License for ngx-admin Backend Bundle

Copyright (c) 2019 Akveo (https://www.akveo.com/)

1. The Developer License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital
work (Bundle) you have selected. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Bundle.

2. You are licensed to use the Bundle to create multiple End Products for yourself or for clients, and the End Product may be Sold.

3. An End Product is a customized implementation of the Bundle, requiring an application of skill and effort.

4. You can create the End Product for a client, and this license is then transferred from you to your client.

5. You can Sell and make any number of copies of the End Product.

6. You can modify or manipulate the Bundle. You can combine the Bundle with other works and make a derivative work from it.
The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license.

7. This license is a “multi-use” license and not a “single application” license,
which means that you can use the Bundle to create more than one unique End Product.

8. You can’t re-distribute the Bundle as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files.
You can’t do this with a Bundle either on its own or coupled with other Bundles, and even if you modify the Bundle.
You can’t re-distribute or make available the Bundle as-is or with superficial modifications.

For example, You can’t purchase a .NET Backend Bundle, convert it to a PHP bundle and sell or give it to more than one client.
You can’t license a Bundle and then make it available as-is on your website for your users to download.

9. You can’t use the Bundle in any application allowing an end user to customize a digital or physical product to their specific needs,
such as an “on demand”, “made to order” or “build it yourself” application.
You can use the Bundle in this way only if you purchase a separate license for each final product incorporating the Bundle that is created using the application.
For example, you can't create a website builder.

10. You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Bundle and use it separately from the End Product.

11. You can’t use a Bundle in a logo, trademark, or service mark.

12. You can only use the Bundle for lawful purposes. Also, if a Bundle contains an image of a person,
even if the Bundle is model-released you can’t use it in a way that creates a fake identity,
implies personal endorsement of a product by the person, or in a way that is defamatory, obscene or demeaning,
or in connection with sensitive subjects.

13. This license applies in conjunction with the Akveo Terms and Conditions.
If there is an inconsistency between this license and the Terms and Conditions,
this license will apply to the extent necessary to resolve the inconsistency.

14. This license can be terminated if you breach it.
If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Bundle from it.

15. Akveo retains ownership of the Bundle but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between Akveo and you.
